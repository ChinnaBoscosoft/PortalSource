            AcME ERP is envisaged as two software applications namely <i>Branch Office</i> and
            <i>Head Office</i> Suites. The Head Office Suite is hosted in a cloud to be accessible
            by all units of a religious or not-for-profit institute. Branch Office suite refers
            to the deployment of AcME ERP for a religious institute or NPO. Each Branch Office
            may have many Projects executed for one or more legal entities. Each Project may
            run in one or more locations. And so, the deployment-site refers to a Branch Office
            or a location of a Project. The software in a Branch Office or its location is always
            linked to a Head Office.
